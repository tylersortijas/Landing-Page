Hello 

This is my first webpage using CSS and Flexbox. The page was based on Spongebob who just came off the top
of my head when creating the page. The page utilizes HTML nesting with some nice CSS elements, brought and formed together through flexbox.
It was a ton of fun to work on this page. Of course like anything else, there was some trials and tribulations, but none that I couldn't handle.
